TTW Mobile Truck Base 3.2 (Optional No Sortomatic)

Any and all credit goes to: https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/66012 
by pintocat for his fantastic conversion to be used with TTW

This file is the same only without any references to https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/41142 and
therefore doesnt require (Sortomatic.esm) it as a master file. Ive tested it somewhat and cleaned it
up afterwards.

PLEASE MESSAGE ME FOR ANY ISSUES YOU MAY ENCOUNTER! (tho i doubt it)
